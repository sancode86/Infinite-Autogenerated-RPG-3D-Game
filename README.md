shadowMap is set to FALSE, for more performance:

```
<script>
  // RENDERER
  const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: false });
  renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
  renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio);
  renderer.shadowMap.enabled = false;
</script>
```
you can change it, be careful!
